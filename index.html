      <p>hello world<p>
      <h2>My favourite vacation spot : OOTY</h2>
      <p>Because of its great <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>climate</b> and is situated in southern part of india and it is the main tourist spot in india it collets three forth of revenue for toursit.
        <br>
        A chain of misty hills spread across a lush green carpet – with plenty to see, enjoy and experience. Ooty is much more than a visitor’s paradise. It lends a piece of itself to its guests that they will be thrilled to take back. One of the most beautiful hill stations in India, Ooty nestles in the Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu. An erstwhile summer resort of the British Raj in India, Ooty has transformed over the years into one of the most sought-after tourism destinations in Tamil Nadu.
